and therefore it will not be true that No A is B ; which was
the original proposition. Aristotle does not assume the con-
version of Ι to prove that of Ε, which would be arguing ina
circle. For a fuller account, see Hamilton on Reid, p. 696.

Alexander himself offers a third proof by syllogism in the
first figure. No A is B, therefore No B is A; for suppose
“SomeBisA‚’'and“NoAisB‚”.·SomeBisnotB.

Having proved the conversios of E, those of A and Ι will
follow from it. “All A is B, therefore Some B is A;'' or else
No B is A, and therefore (by conversion) No A is B; whereas
wc assumed All A is B. And again, Some A is B, therefore
SomeBisA3 or else NoB is A, and therefore NoAis B.

For these proofs, the only assumption necessary is the
principle of contradiction. But proof of any kind is super-
fluous. Conversion and other immediate inferences are
necessary results of the laws of thought, equally evident
and more direct than the mediate inferences by syllogism.
Neither process is dependent on the other.
