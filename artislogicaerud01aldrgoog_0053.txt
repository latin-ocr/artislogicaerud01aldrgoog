of this or that school, it is at least necessary that it
should, in common with the Aristotelian Logic, adhere
to the syllogistic method, whatever modifications or
additions it may derive from the particular school of its
author. In this point of view, the Baeonian school may
be represented by the Logics of Hobbes and Gasscudi3
the Cartesian, by those of Olauberg and Aruauld3 that
of Locke‚ by Le Olera and 'S Gravesaude⁸ 3 that of
Leibnitz, by Wolf, Baurngarten, and his editor Meyer.

our ideas. His work is strictly psychological, examining, on the extreme
sensationalist hypothesis, into the formation of ideas and their different
modes of combination.
