and B is greater than Ο, therefore a fortiori A is greater
than 0? The logical form is,

Whatever ia greater than a greater than G is greater than 0;
A ic greater than a greater than G,
Therefore A is greater than G.

Oris it be required that the a fortiori nature of the
reasoning appear in the conclusion, we must state the
major, “ Whatever is greater than a greater than Gis

. greater than 0 by a greater dffereacess’

of the same kind is the reasoning “A is eqnal to B,
therefore twice A is equal to twice ΒΡ The logical
form is,

The doublea of equal things are equal;
Twioe A and twice B are doubles of equal things,
Therefore they are equal.

The major premise might be stated more generally,
“ Equimultiples cf equal things are equal.’'
