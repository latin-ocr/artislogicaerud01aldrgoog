Deinde illud cujus confirmandi causa fiet Inductio, viden-
dum est utsimile iis rebus sit, quas rea, quasi non
dubias, ente induxerimus¹.'' Quintilian, however, applies
the term rather to the bringing in, as an inference‚ of
the question to be proved. “ Nam illa, qua plurimum
Socrates est neue, hano habuit viam3 curn plura inter-
rogasset, quae fateri adversario necesse esset, novissime
id, de quo quaerebatur, inserebat, cui simile concessisset3
’ id est inductio”.'’ Another meaning of the Greek ἐπάγειν
and ἐπαγωγὸς, as well as of the Latin inducere and in·
ductio, might seem to point rather to the persuading and
- influencing the mind of the hearer¹². But the first de·
rivation is preferable. The question, however, as far as
Aristotle is concemed‚ is not of any great consequence.
For, as that Philosopher did not invent the name, but
only modified the usage of a term current among his
predecessore, the etymology will be of little service
towards illustrating the notion which he attached to it.
