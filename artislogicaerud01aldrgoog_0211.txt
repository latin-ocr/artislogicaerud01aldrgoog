alicujus disciplinae, ut integra facilius discatur.

⁵ Μέθοδος in Aristotle is employed with various shades 01
meaning; l. 101 any instrument of acquiring or communicating
knowledge; as in de An. i. l. 4. πότερον ἀπόδειξίς τίς ἐστιν ἢ tal·
ρεσιςή καί τις ἄλλη μέθοδος. of. Philoponus‚ Scholia, p. 2311, 0. 10.
2. 101 knowledge reduced 10 system; and thus as equivalent
to ἐπιστήμης Phys. Auso. i. l. 1. Eth. Nic. i. 1. 1. Top. i. 2. 2.
3. 101 a systematis treatise on any branoh 01 knowledge,
synonymoua with πραγματείας Ρο111. iv. 2. 1. 11. 2. d. Eth. Nic.
i. 2. 9. But Method‚ in the present sense of awaapemeat, is
not treated ofin the logical writiugs 01 Aristotle, with the
exception of a few rules ,101 the arrangement (τάξις) 01 a dialec-
ticaldisputation in the eighth book of the Topica A lost'
treatise‚ called Methodica is mentioned in the Rhetoric, Ι. 2.
Method‚ as a distinct partos Logic, was first introduced by
Ramus aud 110111 him passed to the logical writings 01 the
Gartesians and 01 (lassandi, by whom it was treated as a
l'ourth part 01 Logia. Like most 01 the additions 1ο the
Aristotelian system, it was originally the property 01 the
Rhetoricians.

¹> Method has been treated 01 by Logicians in two principal
sensas. l. As a process of inference 110111 the known to the
unknown; which is the earlier sense 01 the term, and sano·
tioned by Aristotlc and his Greek interpreters. 2. As an
arrangement 01 truths already known, with a view 01 com-
municating them to others. The last corresponds to the
Greek τάξις, and should rather he called Ordo. Itis distin·
guished 110111 the first by Zaharella and others. Aldrich’s
definition corresponds only 10 the second sense 01 Methodua;
hut in his subsequent division he confounds it with the first.
