· Singulis operationibus sui accidunt defectus.

The definition is too wide, being applicable to the immediate
inferences of Opposition and Conversion, as well as to the
mediata by Argumentation. In all there is a progrees from
one judgment to another. Discursus is more properly dre
progress from two connected judgments to a third resulting
from their connection. Of. Port Royal Logic, Introd. “On
appelle raisonner l'action de notre esprit, par laquelle il forme
un jugement de plusieurs autres.''

of this division of the operatione of the mind, Sir W.
Hamilton has observed, that “it never was proposed as a
psycboloyicol distribution oi the cognitive faculties in yearerol:
but only as a lopicol distribution of that section oi them
which we denominate discursive, as those alone which are
proximately concerned in the process of reasoning.‘' Reid’a
Worlcs‚ p. 242, 692. Hence Aristotle's division, which ie
psycbolcyicol, will not exactly correspond. The nearest ap·
proach to Simple Apprehension is ἡ τῶν ἀδιαιρέτων νοήσεις
but νοήσις ie variously used, and in its widest senso will
embrace all the logical operatione, and even φαντασία, which
belongs rather to the perceptive soul. Scede Aninio, iii.
3. 8. Judgment will correspond nearly to the ὑπόληψις of de
An. iii. 3. 7. (uf. Trendelenburg, Arist. de Animo, p. 469.)
The latter term however is inapplicable to the cognition oi
axiomatis truths. Discursus answers to διάνοια and λογισμόν,
the former term being applied both to the faculty and its
operation. But there ie much uncertainty in the use of all
the above terme. of. Biese, vol. i. p. 89, 327. Hamilton's
Reid, p. 768.

¹The service supposed to bo performed by Logic in
relation to these three defects is more fully and clearly stated
