APPENDlX.

Extnrna is defined by Aristotle, “ proving the major
term of the middle bya term resembling the minor·.”
This definition is obscure, from being worded so as to
contrast with his definition of Induction, in which the
major term is proved of the middle by the minor. It
does not apply to the singular conclusion ultimately
established, but to the universal proposition which forms
the conclusion cf the inductiva portion of the Exemplo.
Thus, if we expand Aristotle’s instance into its complete
form,''ccmposed of en imperfect induction and a syllo-
gism, it will run thus:

The war cf the Thebans and Phocians (D) was an
evil (Α),
The war of the Thebans and Phocians was a war between
neighbours (Β),
All wars between neighbours are evil.
Α war· between the Atheniens and Thebans (O) is a war
between neighbours.
It is an evil.

In this reasoning there are four terms, A the major, B the
middle, 0 the minor, D the ὁμοῖον. The definition applies
to the third proposition, in which A is proved ofB by
means of D. If the final conclusion were taken into
account, the Examplc might be more correctly defined
as a reasoning in which the major term is proved of the
minor by means of a middle, cf which middle the major
has been proved by a term resembling the minor.
