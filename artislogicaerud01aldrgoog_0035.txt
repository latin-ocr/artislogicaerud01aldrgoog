Blemni is the Epaone [opica of Nicephorus Blemmidas, written
in the thirteenth century, which has been quoted as
containing the earliest instance of that system ol logical
mnemonics which the schoolmen afterwards brought to
such perfectioni. The list of Greek logicians cloaes

(ἰαῦ.

scriptos other hun compendia similar in contenta to the snauh, and
haring the appearance of distinct translations from the same original.
To thie must be added the testimony of the Angabnrg MS. used by
Ehinger, (now at Muniam) which ia inscribed τοῦ euandro- Ὶέλλσν als
τὴν ’mim‘ malr &mem abaco.

On the other hand it should be observed,

1⁰. Thai there is in the Bodleian Library (Goth Misc. cclxxv. f. 282. b.)
a MS. inscribed ἐκ τῆς διαλεκτικῆς τοῦ Maior-poe Πέτρον τοῦ ’ἰπνοῦ
cameos exapta rus ns. 1 aava examinet in severo place, md
lind it to correspond exaotly with the work published by Ehinger under
the name of Psellns. Tbere are also extant four other MSS. having the
rame title and the same beginning, (Διαλεκτική ἔστι τέχνη τεχνῦν cal
ἐπιστήμη amnia) ria one at Horence, (Bandini, rol. iii. p. 19.) one
at Madrid, (lriarte, vol. i. p. 276.) one at Vienna, (Lambeo. vol. viii. p.
818.) and one at Milan, (Allatins apud Fabricium, BihL Graec. vol. xi. p.
392. Harles.) of these the three last are expreealy ascribed to Scho-
larius as the translator. A sixth MS. at Moaoow with the name title
is mentioned by Fabricius, (vol. xi. p. 337. florea) bnt I hare not been
able to ascertain any thing about its contenta.

2⁰. Itis evident that the Author ot the Summulse was very ignorant oi
Greek. His derivation of Dialectica. ‘'‘A <lic qnod est deo, et loyor qnod
est semro, vel ieris quod est ratio,⁸ qnasi duorum sermo rel ratio,” could
hardly bave been made by a translator from the Greek Synopsis, where
the derivation ia given correctly.

3⁰. The only mnemonic which occnrs in the body ol the Greek Synopsis
is one for the opposition οἰ· modals, expressed by the words, mumdum
ἰλιάδες rnprwttv ἐκτρέχουσι. The use of the diphthong would hardly haye
occurred to an original writer, though naturally suggested by the purpurea,
iliace, arichim, edentuli of the Latin logician.

On the whole, the weight os evidence seems decidedly in favour ol the
opinion which considers the Greek Synopsis to bc a translation ol the
Summulae os Hispanus, probably made by Georgius Scholarius‚allerwards
known as Gennadius.

For some of the materials of this note I am indebted to a private
communication srom the late Sir W. Hamilton, whose published opinion
bas been referred to already.

ἰ See St Hilaire,Me‘m05re,v01.ii.p. 160. lt may be questioned whether

Α the Latin Logicians are indebted to the Greek in this respect. See Sir

W. Hamilton's Discrassr'ous, p. 128, 671, and below, p. 84.
