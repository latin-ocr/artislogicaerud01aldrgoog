Method in either sense is not properly a part of Pure or
Formal Logia. Itis an application of Logia tc the discovery
or communication of truths in material seience: its rules
: cannot be determined ὰ priori from the laws of thought; but
Ι must be gathered empirically from the examinationes parti-
cular scieuces‚ and will require modification in many instances
from the particular matter with which they have to deal.

⁶ The Mctbodus lucrationis can only be aprocess ol inference:
for no arrangement of parts is possible before they have been
discovered. The discovery oi general principles from individual
objecta of sense, if limited to the inferential process itsels‚
will be Iadaction. The term, however, is sometimes extended
so as to include the ¹preliminary accumulation oi individuals.
In this wider sense it will embrace the sour successive steps
given by Aristoile, Anal. Post. ii. 19· αἴσθησις, μνήμη, ἐμπειρία,
ἔπαγωῄ.

But the Molliculus lactationis must not be absolutely limited
to Induction and its preliminariea though these are the most
important instrumenta of discovery. In soma scieuces‚ as in
mathematica, truths are chiefly discovered by demonstration;
and, till so discovered, cannot, of course, be imparted to others

by the methodus doctrine.
Induction and Syllogism are the only two methods of
inserena. The Greek commentators, Ammonius and Eu-

stratius, enumerate four, adding Division and Definition ; but
in these last there is no reasoning process. See Zabarella,
de Methodis, lib. iii. cap. 5 sqq. If we extend the method of
discovery beyond the process of inserence proper, so as to
include any accumulation of knowledge, we may distinguish
three principal instrumenta. 1. Pure experienca applicahle to
