the Platonic DialogueS, it is impossible to determine
with any accuiucy how much of the doctrines and
methods advocated in those writings is due to the master,
and how much hasbeen added by his disciple. From
the express testimony of Aristotle, however, we may
conclude that Socrates did not, like Plato, maintain the
existence of ideas separate from the sensible phenomena
of the world⁰¹3 and consequantly, that the exaltation of
Dialectic from its tentative use to the rank of the selenae
of absolute being, a view intimately connected with the
ideal theory, is due to Plato rather than to Socrates. To
Plato also probably belong in a great degree the methods
of συναγωγὴ and διαίρεσις, mentioned in the Phaedrus as the
two principal parts of Dialectic, and illustrated at some
length in the Sophistes and the Politicus'. The former
consiste in the collection of a number of scattered
objecta, in reference to one idea, with a view to definition 3
the latter in a gradual dichotomy, by means of contrary
or contradictory members, so as to ascertain as accurately
as possible the number of subordinate species contained
under each genus. Itis the careful performance of this
preesse, proceeding gradually through the intermediate
classes to the lowest, that especially distinguishes the
true dialectic method from the eristic⁰. These pro·
cesses, for which Plato was perhaps in some degree in·
debted to the Eleatic and Megaric Plrilosophyt’, may be

Plato, and this hint has been developed at greater length by Coleridge

in his Treatire mr Metmd. But the eccuracy ol the parallel may be
questioned.
