investigates the urrvarying laws of the heavenly phe·
nomena3 but a practioal science of Lugio, to preserve ·
the mind from error, would be asabsurd asan Astronomy
proposing tc control and regulate the planeta iu their
courses. From these consideratious it follows that,
even grauting Lugio to be, under existing circumstances,
both a speculative and a practical soience, yet the
former is an essential, the latter an occidental feature3
the one is necessarily interwoven with the elementa ol
the system, the other is a contingent result of the
infirmities of those who possess it.

On the other hand, the Loyt'ca utens may be either
lScience or Art, according ιο the purpose to which it is
lapplied¹. Whenever reasonings are employed on any
special object of knowledge, there we have an instance
of tbe Logica utens. The opposite view, which is some-
times talren on account of Aristotle‘s distinction between
the lopiool and the anchtical or ptysteat syllogism,
arises stom a confusion between the Aristotelian and
the later sensas of the term lepical.

It would be both tedicus and unnecessary to discuss
in detail the various accounts that have been given of
the object of Lugio, by those who are agreed as to its
genus Many of these may be passed over, es being
merely verbal varieties cf the same fundamental view⁸.
One or two statements, however, require a brief notice,

¹ “ Distinctio peccat, quia auctores distinotionis vocant Logicam utan-
tem solum usum partis Topica, cum Logica utens vel conjuncta rebus
potissimum dicatur, et de aliis partibus Logica rebus conjunctae numquid
non poterunt applicari rebus ea quea de definitione et divisione demon·
suadumque praccepta traduntur? Ex quo sequitur ιιι Logica utens sit
quandoque vere Scientia, ιιι puta Physica vel Metaphysica, rel siqua
alia est, physicus enim demonstrans mixtum ex elementis esse corruptibile
est Logicns utens, et talis Physica est Logica utens et vere Scientia''
Acerbi Quest. Loy. Qu. IV.

¹ Thus the opinion of Aquinas is virtuully identical with Kant's. and that
cf Scotus with Arobbishop Whately's.
