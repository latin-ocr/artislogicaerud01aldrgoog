¹¹¹ This, and the greater part of the scholastic memorial
verses, are found for the first time in the Sammalca Loyicalea
of Petrus Hispanus afterwards Pope John XXI. who diod in
lavv. He does not, however, profess to be the author of
them; indeed some, including the present, are also noticed
by his contemporary Aquinas as established mnemonics In
slight measure he has been anticipated by the Greeks. A
mnemonic for the opposition of modals is found in the synopsis
attributed to PselluS, and one for the syllogistie moods in
Nicephorus Blemmidas. But the genuineness of that portion
of the works of Aquinas has been questioned, and the treatise
which goes under the name of Pselius is probably a transla-
tion of the Summulae of Hispanus. The latter work is thus
our earliest undoubted authority for these curious specimens
of scholastic ingenuity. See below, p. 84. note z.

¹¹ This is argued at some length in a thesis appended to
Wallis’s Logic ; and is, to say the least, by far· tho most con-
venient way of bringing singular propositione underthe
existing rules of the syllogism. At the same time it may be
remarked that the employment of singular terms as predicates
is unnatural and the reasoning‚ at least in affirmative syl·
logisms‚ worthless. See An. Pr. ij 27. 3. Indeed it may be
questioned whether the ἕκθεσις of Aristotle (see below, p. 61.) “
was regarded by him as a syllogism at all² cf. Aquinas,
