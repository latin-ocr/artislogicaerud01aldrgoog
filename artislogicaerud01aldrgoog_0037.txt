now generally allowed to be spurious, but probably
written about the same peri0d; the other, an unfinished
treatise called Principio Dialectica, the commencement
of an essay on language with a view to disputation.
Το these must be added the singular allegory of Mar·
cianus Capella, on the Marriage of Mercnry and Philo·
logy; a medley of prose and verse, composed probably
towards the end of the fifth century. The Seven Liberal
Arts, afterwards so celebrated as forming the Triviam,
and Quadrivium, or Eneyelopaedia of the middle ages,
appear in the following order, Grammar, Dialectic,
Rhetoric, Geometry, Arithmetic, Astronomy, and Musiem.
Dialectic is represented as a female of a sour counte-
nance, holding in her left hand a serpent, and in her
right a hoolr baited with sundry formulae. She discloses
her wisdom by a brief abstract of the lsagoge of Por·
phyry and of the first three treatises of Aristode. This
is followed by an account 01 hypothetieal syllogisms;
and the lady is about to proeeed to an exposition of
sophisms, when she is interrupted and very summarily
dismissed by Minerva.

BoethiuS, in the sixth century, is the only commentator
proper among the Latius. He has left a considerable
number of valuable logical werke, viz. two commentaries
on the lsagoge 01 Porphyry, one on the (lategories, two
on the De Inte1·pretati0ne,and translations oi the other
parts of the Organ0n; besides original treatises on the

Ν Μ. St. Hilaire has committed an oversight in citing the division of
the Seven Liberal hrts srom the Dialectic cf Angustiae. No such division
occurs there3 though one nearly the same is found in his second Book
De Ordine, ch. 13. M. Hanreau (de la Pltilosopltte Selmlasthue, vol. i.
p. 21.) attributes tbe invention oi this classification 10 (lapella, which is
hardly reconcileable with the above reference. The Seven Liberel Arta
were afterwards exhibited in the following mnemonic:

‘¹ Gram. loquitur, Dia. vera docet, atei. verba colorat,
Mus. canit, Ar. numerat, (leo. ponderat, Ast. colit astra.”
