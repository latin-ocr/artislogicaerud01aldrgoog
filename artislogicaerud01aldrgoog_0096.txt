§. 2. Quourrn vero, inter docendum et dispu-
tandum, neque res aliqua, neque conceptus cui

instrumenta, iisqueintcllcctum dirigentia cognitionererum. Lepica
docens dicitur quae praecepta tradit; utens, quae praeceptis
utitur. Officium Logicae docentis, est tradere praecepta et
modum efficiendi instrumenta, quibus mens dirigitur in cog·
nitione rerum, instrumentorumque naturam describere. In·
strumenta Legite sunt quatuor, detritio, divisio, syllcyiemea
et methodus. ' Officium Logicae utentis. est instrumenta, cum
opus est, efficere, iisque mentem dirigere, ne in quaerenda
rerum cognitione hallucinetur.” From this it appears that
the knowledge of tlrinqe was regarded by this school as only
the remote object of the Lopicc utens, as applied to this or
that matter, and hence not to be gained from any logical
treatise. Thus the distinction insisted upon by some critics
between ie cognitione and in cognitionem, is of no value3 both
being merely verbal variatione in expressing the same view.
This definition of Logic as an Art arose from the dialec-
tical and rhetorical innovatione introduced by the reformers
of Logic in the latter part of the fifteenth century, and was
adopted universally by Remus and his followers, as well as
by the Peripatetico-Ramista of the school of Keekermann,
and afterwards hythe Cartesians Among the earlier philo-
sophers‚ the Peripatetics considered Logic to be neither Art ι
nor Science‚ but an Instrument. The Stoice regarded it as a
Science, in which they were followed by the Schoolmen.
Subsequently, in the schools of Wolf and Kant, Logic again
obtained the name of Science, though the former regarded it
as a practical, the latter, more correctly‚ as a speculative
sciense. uf. Zabarella de Nocere Lopicoe, lib. i. Smigleeii
