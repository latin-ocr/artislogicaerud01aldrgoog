Nam l. sit vera Ed, puta Nullum A ert B .· Ergo!

b Per cccidcaa; so called becauseit is not a conversion
of the universal per sc, but by reason of its containing the
particular. For the proposition ‘⁴ Some B is A,” is primariiy
the converse of “ Some A is B.” recondarity of ‘⁶ All A is B.”
See Boethius, de Syll. Cat. p. 589.

Conversion by contraposition‚ which is not employed
by Aristotle, is given by Boethius in his first book, Dc
Syttopisrno Oatrqorico. He is followed by Petrus Hispanus,
who first gives the mnemonic‚ as above. It should be ob-
'served that the old Logicians‚ following Boethius, main·
tain, that in conversion by contraposition, as well as in
the others, the quality should remain unchanged. Gon·
sequently the converse of “All A is B” is “All not B is
not A,” and of “Some A is not B,'' “Some not B is not
not A.’' Itis simplet, however, to convert A into Ε andO
into I, (“ No notBisA;’' “Some notBis A,”) as is done by
Wallis and Apr Whately; and before Boethius by Apuleius
and Capella, who notice the conversion, but do not give ita
name. The principle of this couversion may be found in
Aristotle, Top. ii. 8. l. though he does not employ it for
logical purposes. ⁶

‘¹ Sit cera Ε. This is the proof given by Theophrastus
and Eudemus. (Alexander, Scholia, p. 148. b. 29.) Aristotle
proves it by the method called ἔκθεσις, i. e. by the cchibttica
of an individuel instance, (ἐκτιθέναι capoocrcscasut: whence a
syllogism with singular premises is called syllogismus crepo
citerius.) Thus, No Ais B, therefore No B is A, for if not,

Some iodtriduct B, say O, is A. Then G is both A and B, ¹
