the identity of Thought and Being in general, the several
identical determinations of the one and the other. Such
a process is not thought, but its negation. lf the Uni-
verse had one consciousness, the system might bc
possible3 for Thought and Being are identical only in
und through consciousness But such universal con-
sciousness could not be my consciousness3 and thus
the Hegelian assumption cannot be grasped by any act
of human thought. On the other hand, thought without
consciousness is inconceivable3 since it implius a ne·
gation of the one essential characteristic under which
all thought is presented to the human mind. The logical
notion which is not a function of my own personal
thought, is a mere empty abstraction, inconceirable by
reason3 and the system deduc-ed from it is incompatible
with those regulatire truths that are above reason.
Vulgar Rationalism subjecta belief to thought ; it has
been reserred for Transcendental Philosophy to subject
it to the annihilatiou of thought.

Speculative philosophy has had three great periodS‚
each of which has been consummated by a critical
system of which Formal Logic hasbeen a constituent
portion. The Eleatic and Platonic metaphysica found
their consummation in Aristotle3 the Scholastic Philo·
sophy in Occam; that of the serenteenth and eighteenth
centurias in Kant. But from the Kantion philosophy

, has arisen another phase ol speculation, not less dogmatic

in its positione, not less extravagaut in its aims, not less
unstable in its foundations. A criticism which shall sift
thoroughly the protensions of this philosophy, it remains
for the present generation to acco plish.
