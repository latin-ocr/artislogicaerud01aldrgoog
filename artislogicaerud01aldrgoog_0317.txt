ΟΝ THE HYPOTHETICAL SYLLOGISM.

Timr the συλλογισμοὶ ἒξ ὑποθέσεως of Aristotle are not
identical with those which, since the time of Theophrastus
and Eudemus, have been received in Logic as Hypothe-
tical Syllogisms‚ is now generally admitted⁸. The vvord
Hypotdetical is never by Aristotle opposed to Cote-
yoricol, hut to ostensive (herxrrxtsbk and be remarks that
the Syllopc'stic portion of the reasoning in Hypotbetical
Syllogisms is ostensive, aud requires no reduction; hut
that the determination of the original question is not
effeoted by Syllogism at all, and cannot be exhibited in
Syllogistic form. The meaning of this may be clearly
explained by examples.

Of the H ypothetical Syllogism‚ tvvo‘priucipal kinds are
mentioned hy Aristotle. One is the ἀπαγωγὴ εἰς ri ethere:
theotherisaSyllogismofwhichtheconclusiveuessdepends
entirely on agreement between two contending partiea
and vvhich is therefore chiefly servioeable in dialectic
disputatiou. The latter may be exhibited as follows.

The original question being to prove that some A is
not B; the contending parties agree to the hypothesis,
that if some A is not Ο, it is not B. The reasoning
proceeds thus:

NoXis O;
All X is A3 (συλλογισμὸς ἐξ ὑποθέσεως.)

Therefore‚ Some A is not Ο.

⁸ We must except M. St. Hilalre‚ who professes to discover the ordinary
Hypotheticals in Auel. Prior. i. 44. 1. But the textos Aristotle vvill hardly
verrant the assertion. cf. Sir W. Hamilton‚ Discussions‚ p. 152, md Ed.)
Lectores on Lepte, ii. p. 387. In the latter ploce, Sir W. Hamilton uoticas
that Aristotle has himself described the process of reasoning commonly
called hypothetioal, but denies it to be a syllogism. See Anat. Pr. i. 32. 7.
b See Auel. Pr. i. 23. 2.
