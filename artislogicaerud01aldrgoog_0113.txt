¹ “Genus speciebus motoria est. Nam sicut aes, accepto
forma, transit in statuam, ita genus, accepta differentia, nonsit
in speciem.” Boethius dc divisione. But as logicians, we nro
not warranted in introducing any portianos the essence oi
things, but only of concepta or general actions. 'I'he whole
essence of a concept is the snm of the attributes which it ‚¹
comprohends, and this can only be fully declared by its·
dotatricis, not, as Aldrich says, by specics. The Gcom or ·
mancat port os two cioca concepta, (to speak of the material or
formal part of asioqlc concept is nonscnso,) is the sum oi
those attributes which are common to both ; as the differam
or sormot port is composed of those attributes which are
peculiar to each. Thus, if there be given three concepta,

containing respectively the attributes, ob, oc, bc, o is the
genus ol the first compared with the second, b and c the
respective differences But il the first is compared with the
third, b becomes the common genus, a and c the respective
differences. In this, the only tenable logical point of new,
there can be no such thing as an absolute genus or
differente.

tNoccororio-(loonioycotcr. This distinction is based on
the supposition that certain attributes are necessarily con·
nected with others, from which they flow, as effect from
cause. Thus risibility was described in the scholastic philo·
sophy as necessarily flowing from rotmootity, in the samo
manner as having the angles at the base edual to each other
necessarily results from the aquality of two sides in an
