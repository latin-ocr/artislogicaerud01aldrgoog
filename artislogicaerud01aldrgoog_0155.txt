¹¹ These (100000 010 00 attempt 10 reduce all the three
figures 01 syllogism directly to a single principle; the dictum
de omni 01 nullo 01 Α11010110, which was universally adopted
by the scholastic Logicians, being direetly applicable to the
first figure only. This reduction, so long as the predicate
ι 01 propositione has no expressed quantity, is illegitimate;
the terms not being equal, but contained one within another,
00 10 denoted bytho names major and rainer. Hence, 00
applied to the first figure, the word 00000110011100 to express
01000 and the 00010 11100, the relation 01 0 greater to elesa,
and 010 1000 10 0 greater,—of a predicate to a subject, and 01
a subject to a predicate. In the system 01 Sir W. Hamilton,
by assigning a quantity to the predicate, the terme 01 every
proposition 010 equal in extent; and the Oanons become
legitimate representatives 01 the syllogism ; but in this 0000

Wallia mentions the Oanons as recent innovatione in Logic.
