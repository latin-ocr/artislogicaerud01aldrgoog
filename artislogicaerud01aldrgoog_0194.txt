every disjunctive proposition. We may hoppen to lmow that
two altematives cannot be true together, so that the affirmation
of the second necessitates the denial of the first, and the
affirmation of the first the denial of the second; but this, as
Boethius observes, is a material, not a sonnol consequence,
whether it be stated in the hypothetical or disjunctive iorm.
It must be allowed that the examples sometimes adduced on
this side of the question have not been very happily chosen.
It sounds oddly enough to state a known truth as a possible
falsehood, as in the instance, “ Bellum Trojonum cambit ccl
Homerus ccl Virqilivn.'' But other and more natural specimens
have been given; e. g. “ Ant olim Troja fuit, aut historio dc
bello Trojano cst mero fabulo.” The case is still clearer when
both members of the disjunctive are negative, as in the
example given by Boethius, “Si enim quis dicat, autnon
est album aut non est nigrum, sive album non esse as·
sumpserit, non necesse erit esse vel non esse nigrum: sive
nigrum non esse assumpserit, ut sit vel non sit album, nullam
faciet necessitatem.” On this supposition only two of the
above syllogisms are valid, which may be reduced to hypothe-
ticals as follows:
constructive. , Destructive.
