Aristotle acknowledges only three figures; looking rather to
the extension of the middle term, as compared with the other
two, than to its position in the two promises. In this point
61 view there are only three figures possible ; for the relative
extensione 61 6166 major and minor terms being given, the

Fapesmo, Frisesmo. The three first are clearly Barbara,
Celarent Darii, with the conclusione converted. With regard
to the two 1666, the process is a little moro intricate. They
have negative minor premises, and thus offend against a
