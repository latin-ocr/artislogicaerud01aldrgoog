bomo est doctae Iudaicum, quae (terminum com-
munem sine signo, et proinde) ancipitem: nam
manente formula, vim recipit diversam ; ut, Homo

ert animal, nempe omnic: Homo est doctas, aliquia
scilicet.

Petitur haec Divisio a Quantitote Propositionis:

xlviii. de Int. cap. 7. of these, the two first will clearly form
singular propositione. With regard to the last, it has been
doubted whether they properly form singulare or particulare.
Vives maintains them to be singulars; observin'g, that qzcidom
is not more indefinite than Socrates to one who is not ac·
quainted with the man. But there is this difference. If
we say, “quidam concionatur‚” “ quidam legit‚” there is no
evidence that the same person is spoken of in the two pro-
positions ; while Socrates, except by a mere quibble, will always
designate the same person. There may indeed be two persons
of the same name ; but in this case the name fails to accom-
plish the intended distinction, and we must specify Socrates
the son of Sophroniscus. Hence aliquia and qnidam are pro·
perly called particulare. uf. Wallis, Logia, lib. 2. cap. 4. “

and replaced by indempnatos Hamilton on Reid, p. 692.
This proposition has no claim to a place in Lugio, being only
the negation of any logical quantity at all. The true in-
definite proposition is in fact the particular ; the statement
‘⁴ some A is B” being applicable to an uncertain number of
instantes, from the whole class down to any portion of it.
For this reason particular propositione were called indefinites
by Theophrastus. See Ammoniusia de lot. f. 63 a. ed.
