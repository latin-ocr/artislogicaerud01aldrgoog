· name among the Schoolmen: the triumph of Nominalism
involved the downfall of the principal applicatione ol
the scholastic method. Buridan‚ his disciple, the reputed
author of the sophism called Asinus Baridaniv, deve-
loped the doctrines of Nominalism to a still further
extent, but has the character of having pushed to an
extreme point the subtleties distinctiva of the scho-
lastic system. Another philosopher of the same period,
Walter Butley, is the author of some commentaries on
the Logic and Physics of Aristode, and deserves mention
as the author oi an attempt to extend the narrow his-
torical knowledge of the period by a work entitled
de cita et moribus philosophorum et poetarum. This
work, of which the philosophica] portion extends from
Thales to Seneca, is in part compiled from Laertius,
whose work the author seems to have possessed in a
more complete form than that which is now extenta
ln itself however it is of small value and contains many
errors‘.

The reaction against the Scholastic Logic began in
the fifteenth century. Laurentius Valla, Rodolphus
Agricola, and Lndovicus Vives, successively attached
the system in 1440, 15161, and 1531. Their 'attacks
were directed, partly against the Latinity‚ partly against
the matter oi the School Logic. The additions proposed
by these reformers are chiefly rhetorical innovatione
from Cicero and Quintilian.

have held a middle course between Nominalism and Reolism. See
Haureau, vol. ii. p. 476. Brucher classes him with the nominalistS,
Tenncmann with the realists.

¹ Agricola died in 1485. His three books De Inventione Dialectica were

a posthumous work, first published in an imperfect form at Louvain in
11116.
