that its object is uot the three operatione of the reason,
but the Syllogism¹. His commentaries bear out his·
cognomen3 consisting for the most part of minute dis·
tinctions, suggested by the text of his author, with argn-
ments on both sides precisely stated, and distinctions
drawn to the extreme of subtlety. Scotus, lilre Aquinas,
was a Realist, and the more consistentes the two. He
held that the universal existed in the individual, not
really, as his predecessor had taught, but scrmnllyh
Hence the rival sects ot‘ Themista and Scotists, the latter
of whom ultimately adopted the name of Formalists.
Both agreed, however, in opposition to Nominalism.
From the school of Scotus, however, arose the great
reviver of'Nominalism, William Occam, the Invincible
Doctor, the ablest writer in Logic whom the Schools
have produced. His doctrine, like that of Abelard, was
really Conceptualisml. The Summa totius Loyr'coe of
Occam is the most valuable contribution of the middle
ages to the Loyicc dcccco. If we do not subscribe to the
hyperbole of his editor, Mark of Beneventum, who,
borrowing from the well-known eulogy of Plato, declares
that if the Gods used Logic, it would be the Logic of
Occam, we may fairly allow, with M. St. Hilaire, that it
is the clearest and most original of the works of that
period. Occam, like Petrus Hispanus, departs from the
ordinary arrangement of treating consecutively the lsa-
goge of Porphyry and the several books of the Organon.
He commences with the different divisione of terme, of
which his account is much more complete than that of
the Sammulce Loyr'cnlcc. He then proceeds to the pre·
dicableS, introduced by a defence of the nominalist view
of universale, then to definition, division, and the cate·
