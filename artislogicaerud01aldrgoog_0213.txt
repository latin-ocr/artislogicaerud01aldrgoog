(ἱ The Marma Doctrina is notin the samo sense a process
os inference from known to unknown; sor tho parts are sup
posed to be known already to the toacher, andare methodically
arranged for the benefit of the leamer. This then corresponds
rather to Order than to Method iu the proper sense. It may
be an arrangement either of the whole or of a portion oia
subject; and is thus either universal or particular. Gi.
Zabarella‚ de Methodis‚ lib. ii. cap. 20. The distinction
between the Perfect and Imperfect Method is not usually
recognised by writers on the subject. hldrich is thinking ol
the acroamctic and cacteris teaching of Aristotle and others;
the characteristic feature of the latter being the suppression
of certain doctrines as not fitted for a promiscuous audience.
Whereas the universal and particular Methods merely relate
to the whole and the parts in the same exposition.

⁰ On Synthesis and Analysis and the various employment
of both, some remarks will be found in the Appendix, note G.
The notion of Synthesis in the present passage corresponds
to that of Metaphysical parts and whole, which is there men·
tioned as applicable to a syllogistic process from a general
principle to its particular application. Not so that of Analysis3
which in the present passage is also aprocess from the universal
to the particular, not srom the particular to the universal.
By Sabjectam is meant the most general Subject whose pro-
perties the Science investigatas ; as Magnitude in Geometry.
