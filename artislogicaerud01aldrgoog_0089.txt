1. Simplex Apprebeario, est nudus re'i con-
ceptus intellectivus⁶, similis quodammodo per-
ceptioni sensitivam sicut enim Imago rei estin

divisio, nisi simplicium apprehensorum. Secunda vero ordi·
natur ad tertiam: quia videlicet oportet quod ex aliquo vero
cognito, cui intellectus assentiat, procedatur ad certitudinem
accipiendam de aliquibus ignotis. Cum autem Logica dicatur
rationalis scientia, necesse estquod ejus consideratio versetur
circa ea, quae pertinent ad tres praedictas operationes rationis.”
Aquinas in Periherm. Lect. 1. ef. Opusc. xlviii. Tract de SylL
cap. 1. The passage alluded to by Aquinas is De An. iii. 6. 1.
ἢ μὲν οὖν τῶν ἀδιαιρέτων νόησις ἐν τούτοις περὶ d οὐκ ἔστι τὸ desider
s ἐν οἷς δὲ τὸ ψεῦδος καὶ τὸ ἀληθές, σύνθεσίς τις ἤδη νοημάτων ὦσπερέν
ὄντων. Ἀδιοίρετα are either ἀριθμῷ or εἴδει. Metaph. ix. 1. 4.
The latter only are νοητά, the former αἰσθητά. ostendenti.

⁰ Simple Apprehension‚ in the only sense in which it can
have any connection with Logic, is an operation of Thospia,
and is more properly called Conceptioa. It is necessary to
distinguish Thought, which is representative, and whose
immediate objectis an universal action, gained by comparison
and indifferently applicable to many individuale, from the
various intuitivc faculties‚ which are preseatatiad and whose
immediate object is an individnal thing, act, or state cf mind,
existing without or within ourselves. This distinction is
properly psychological, but must be carefully borne in mind
in reference to the logical character of Thought A fuller
explanation is given in Prolepomeaa Lagina, Ghap. I.

‘1 Among various intuitive faculties, it is necessary to dis·
tinguish between sonatan, Porceptioa and [aagendam. The
two former are distinguished by Stewart Oatta'nea os Mora
Philosopbp,§.15. ‘⁴ Socratica expresses merely that change
in the state of the mind which is produced hyan impressiore
upon an organ of sensc; of which change we can conceive the
mind to be consciens without any knowledge of external
objects. The word Perceptioa expresses the knowledge vve
obtain, by means ol our sensatione, of the qualities of matter.’¹
